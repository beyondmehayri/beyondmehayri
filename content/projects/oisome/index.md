      <h4>
        Former chain of japanese store "Usupso" opened a new lifestyle store "O!some". The biggest part of customers are teenagers, then women and children. Here are two concepts. The first is black with bright brandwall at the end. The products are colourful, so they would stand out on a black background. Also there is a customize zone, where you could make your purchase unique.
