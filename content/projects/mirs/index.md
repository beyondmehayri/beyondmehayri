          The task was: not to have a lot of design, because the main goal is to show household appliances. The interesting part of the project was the size of goods. When a product is big such as a fridge, oven, kitchen hood, or washing machine, you can't just put it on a beautiful shelf. The spice of the project is suspended structures for ovens, coffee machines, and small household appliances. They float in the air right in front of the customer's eyes. The space is divided into 3 parts: exposition, experience zone, where you can try how the product works, and cooking zone for shows and lectures. Deep blue color and walnut wood texture were mostly used to calm the interior. But bright blotches of furniture dilute the restful interior.
