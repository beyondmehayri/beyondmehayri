      <h4>
        The restaurant should be mostly for youth. It should be bright, colourful and unusual. Also easy to clean, besause it is fast food. The country is enormous hot, so the materials mainly should be cold. Here, the first concept has different sitting types for different kind of audience. The bar counter where you can sit alone, capsules for 2 persons, sofas for big group of friends. Also modern rethinking of Uzbekistan's teahouse "chayhana" with pillows on magnets.
