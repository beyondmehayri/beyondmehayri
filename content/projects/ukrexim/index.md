      <h4>
        A bank of the future shouldn't look like a bank. It should be a lab of exchanging experiences, even big deals should be made in a relax atmosphere. A client should be calm and sure in bank reliability. Monochrome, thin graphic lines, elegance, like man in black suit with Rolex on his hand. Service model serves two types of client: individual and corporate. First floor is for individuals. we have a big zone of quick operations, and the further we go to the department, the longer the operation. There is a separate entrance for special clients with their personnel manager. The second floor is for corporate clients. There is a kitchen for small talkings, formal and informal meeting rooms and skype-cabins. The bank in general is a workshop hub, where you can plan your life.
