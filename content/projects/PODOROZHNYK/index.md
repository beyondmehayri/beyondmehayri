      <h4>
        The pharmacy has a new service model. Before checkout merchandising was a barrier between a customer and a seller. The seller should go to another room to bring a medicine or to turn his back to a client. We created a new service model a "library". A seller doesn't need to leave a client or turn his back. The whole medicine are in the "library". The client sees the seller, the seller doesn't turn his back and there is no barriers anymore. The whole cashdesk merchandising is nearby. The choreography is that merchandising of the cashdesk leads to the cashdesk. A client has time to think and choose.
